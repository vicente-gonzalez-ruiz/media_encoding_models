\section{Single Layer Coding (SLC)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most audio and image/video codecs generate non-scalable
  streams. In the case of video, only one quality, resolution and
  picture-rate are available at decoding time.
\item The decoding of a single layered stream generates a
  reconstruction whose quality can be modeled as linearly proportional
  to the amount of decoded data.
\end{itemize}

\section{\href{http://eeweb.poly.edu/~yao/EL6123/scalablecoding.pdf}{Multiple Layer Coding (MLC)}}
\begin{itemize}
\item A media encoded in several layers can be decoded to provide (in
  the case of video) different picture-rates (time scalability),
  different resolutions (spatial scalability) and different qualities
  (quality scalability).
\item In some codecs (such as JPEG2000), spatial random access it is
  available ROI (Region-Of-Interest) or WOI (Window-Of-Interest)
  scalability. ROI is used in special imaging, such as
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography}{mammography}. WOI
  can useful in the retrieving of high-resolution video sequences such
  as \href{http://jhelioviewer.org/linux.html}{JHelioviewer}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Multiple Description Coding (MDC)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple description codecs provides a set of partially
  redundant streams so that the quality of the reconstructions improve
  with the number of descriptions decoded.
\item An example of this type of encoding is the scene segmentation
  (video object coding) provided by
  \href{http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/MM/BSC_MM_CALLER/PDF/12_CM340_MPEG4_VIDEO.pdf}{MPEG-4}.

%\section{C/S (Client/Server) model}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The server sends all data.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{CDN (Content Distribution Network) model}
%\fig{300}{CDN_model.png}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Server (and channels) are replicated.
%\item All servers store the same content (data must be replicated).
%\end{itemize}

%\section{P2P (Peer-to-Peer) model}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Peers helps the server.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{IP Multicast model}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item The routers do most of the job.
