\section{Unicast vs Multicast}
\begin{itemize}
\item A unicast transmission sends data from a single sender to a
  single receiver.
\item A multicast transmission sends data from a single server to more
  than one receiver.
\end{itemize}

\section{Anycast}
\begin{itemize}
\item A anycast transmission sends data from a single sender to a
  single receiver, but like in multicast, the receiver is not controlled
  by the sender.
\end{itemize}

\section{Client/server (CS) vs peer-to-peers (P2P models}
\begin{itemize}
\item In a CS model, the data is sent by a server (or a cluster of
  servers such as in a CDN (content Delivery Network)) and received
  directly by one or more clients.

\item As in the CS model, in a P2P model, the data is sent by one or
  more server, but the rereivers (peers) are able to relay the data in
  order to reduce the bandwidth comsumption at the server side.

  The P2P model is also called ALM (Application Multicast Model).
\end{itemize}

%\section{C/S (Client/Server) model}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The server sends all data.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{CDN (Content Distribution Network) model}
%\fig{300}{CDN_model.png}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Server (and channels) are replicated.
%\item All servers store the same content (data must be replicated).
%\end{itemize}

%\section{P2P (Peer-to-Peer) model}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Peers helps the server.
%\end{itemize}

%\section{IP Multicast model}
%\fig{300}{IPM_model.png}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The routers do most of the job.
%\end{itemize}
